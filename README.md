exceljs-hardened
[!WARNING] This is an unofficial, unaffiliated fork of exceljs. It exists to maintain the security of a widely-used library whose upstream appears unmaintained: no response channel currently works (Discord is gone, GitHub private vulnerability reporting is disabled on the upstream repo), and several real vulnerabilities have gone unpatched as a result.

This fork is not endorsed by, and has no relationship with, the original exceljs maintainers. It is not a general-purpose continuation of the project — it exists specifically to carry security fixes for known, reported issues that upstream cannot currently receive.

Why this exists
exceljs is depended on by a large number of Node.js applications for reading/writing .xlsx/.csv files. Several vulnerabilities in the upstream code have real, demonstrated impact (prototype pollution, arbitrary local file read, unbounded decompression) and no way to be responsibly disclosed to, or fixed by, the original project. Rather than let users choose between "stay vulnerable" and "stop using the library," this fork patches those specific issues and republishes under a different package name so they don't collide with the official one on npm.

What's patched
ID	Vulnerability	Fixed in	Status
VULN-01	Prototype pollution in _.deepMerge() (lib/utils/under-dash.js)	5.0.0	✅ Patched
VULN-02	Arbitrary local file read via addImage({filename}) (lib/doc/workbook.js, lib/xlsx/xlsx.js)	5.0.0	✅ Patched
VULN-03	CSV / formula injection in CSV.write() (lib/csv/csv.js)	5.0.0	✅ Patched
VULN-04	Decompression bomb / memory exhaustion in Workbook#load() (lib/xlsx/xlsx.js)	5.0.0	✅ Patched
All four issues identified in the original audit are now patched and verified against live proof-of-concept exploits (see ../../poc/exceljs — the same PoC tools that demonstrated each vulnerability were re-run against a demo app wired to this fork to confirm the fixes hold).

See SECURITY.md for how to report new issues, and each patch's inline [exceljs-hardened] comments in the source for the technical rationale.

VULN-01 — Prototype pollution
_.deepMerge() now refuses to assign into __proto__, constructor, or prototype keys, closing the path from a JSON-parsed cell.note object to the global Object.prototype.

VULN-02 — Arbitrary local file read
addImage({filename}) and the internal media writer reject any raw path containing a .. segment (assertSafeMediaPath) — but that alone does not fix the realistic exploit chain, and testing against a live target confirmed it: the typical vulnerable pattern is

const resolvedPath = path.join(baseDir, userInput);   // e.g. userInput = '../../../.env'
workbook.addImage({filename: resolvedPath});
path.join() already resolves and strips .. segments before addImage() ever sees the string (path.join('/app/assets/logos', '../../../.env') → '/app/.env', with no .. left in it) — so a check performed after the join has nothing left to catch.

The actual fix is ExcelJS.utils.safeJoin(baseDir, userInput), which resolves the path and checks containment as a single operation instead of two separate steps:

const ExcelJS = require('exceljs-hardened');

// throws: Refusing to resolve "../../../.env" against base directory
// "/app/assets/logos": it resolves to "/app/.env", which is outside the
// base directory.
const safePath = ExcelJS.utils.safeJoin('/app/assets/logos', '../../../.env');
If your application builds an addImage({filename}) path from user input, you must use safeJoin() instead of path.join() — this is not optional defense in depth, it's the fix. See the demo app's ../../poc/exceljs/webapp-hardened/server.js for the before/after, and lib/utils/media-path-guard.js for the full rationale (including why the naive assertSafeMediaPath-only version of this patch shipped in an earlier draft and failed against a live PoC before this fix was added).

VULN-04 — Decompression bomb
Workbook#load() now reads each zip entry's declared uncompressed size from the archive's central directory before decompressing it, and refuses to proceed if a single entry (default cap: 128MB) or the archive as a whole (default cap: 512MB) would exceed a sane limit — without ever materializing the bomb in memory.

// throws: Refusing to decompress "xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml": declared
// uncompressed size (1610612736 bytes) exceeds the per-entry limit ...
await workbook.xlsx.load(maliciousBuffer);

// Both limits are configurable if your legitimate files are larger:
await workbook.xlsx.load(buffer, {
  maxEntryUncompressedSize: 256 * 1024 * 1024,
  maxTotalUncompressedSize: 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
});
VULN-03 — CSV / formula injection
CSV.write() now prefixes any value beginning with =, +, -, @, tab, or CR with a leading apostrophe before handing it to fast-csv. Every mainstream spreadsheet application treats a leading ' as "force this cell to be text" — the apostrophe itself isn't shown, so the cell still displays exactly as written, it just never gets evaluated as a formula.

const rows = [['Item', '=cmd|"/c calc"!A0']];
rows.forEach(r => sheet.addRow(r));
await workbook.csv.writeBuffer();
// -> Item,'=cmd|"/c calc"!A0
//    (the payload is now inert text, not a live formula)
This is applied to the default mapper and to any custom options.map you supply — the wrapping happens after your mapper runs, so it protects custom export logic too. If you need the raw, unescaped behavior (e.g. a purely numeric export you've already validated), opt out explicitly:

await workbook.csv.writeBuffer({escapeFormulas: false});
Installing
npm install exceljs-hardened
The API is otherwise unchanged from upstream exceljs@4.4.0 — this is a drop-in replacement:

- const ExcelJS = require('exceljs');
+ const ExcelJS = require('exceljs-hardened');
What this fork does not do
It does not track every upstream change — it starts from exceljs@4.4.0 plus the specific security patches above. If upstream ever becomes active again, migrating back to the official package is recommended.
It makes no claim of a full, independent security audit beyond the four issues listed above.
Upgrading from 4.x
5.0.0 deliberately breaks a few edge cases that upstream 4.4.0 used to allow silently, because those edge cases were the exploitable behavior:

addImage({filename}) now throws on a raw path containing .., and Workbook.utils.safeJoin() (new) is the supported way to build such a path from user input — see the VULN-02 section above.
Workbook#load() now throws by default on any zip entry declaring more than 128MB uncompressed, or an archive totalling more than 512MB — both configurable via options.maxEntryUncompressedSize / options.maxTotalUncompressedSize if your legitimate files are larger.
CSV.write() now prefixes formula-trigger characters with ' by default — opt out per-call with {escapeFormulas: false} if you rely on the raw output.
If you hit one of these in an existing app, it means the input in question matches the exact shape that was exploitable — that's the point. Adjust the input, raise the relevant limit deliberately, or opt out for that call site if you've already validated it's safe.
